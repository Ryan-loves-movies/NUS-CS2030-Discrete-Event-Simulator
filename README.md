# NUS-CS2030-Discrete-Event-Simulator
Discrete Event Simulator built and refined throughout Y1S1 of NUS CS2030 to schedule customers with waiters and self-service kiosks based on service times and random rest times of servers.

- To try out the simulator, ensure at least java 17 is installed
- a simple "java Main < sampleTestFile.in" in jshell would suffice to present the schedule
